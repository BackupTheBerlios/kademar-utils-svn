   I. Installing and configuring MPD

 - Installing:
  sudo apt-get install mpd
You may also want to install mpc which is a console client.

 - Configuring:
Just edit the file /etc/mpd.conf and then restart MPD.
You will have to edit the path music_directory.
MPD runs by default on port 6600.

 - Starting & Stoping:
  sudo /etc/init.d/mpd {command}
  Where {command} is: start, stop or restart


  II. MPD Screenlet options

 - Screenlet options:
Here you can set the position of the screenlet, its transparency, and some other
window options.
The option 'Resize on mouse scroll' cannot be activated in this program beacause
the mouse scroll is used inside the playlist.

 - MPD Connection:
You can change the host, the port and the password used by this client.
Also, you can set the rate of queries sent to the server.

 - MPD Cover Art:
You can set where the cover art will be saved, by default the cover arts are not
saved at all.
The default path to save the cover arts is '~/.covers/', but this screenlet will
not create it. The user MUST manually create the directory.

 - MPD Display & Others:
How the screenlet is rendered.
