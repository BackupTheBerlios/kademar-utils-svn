"Glossyk" Kopete Chat Window Style
Version 1.0

A nice looking, modern and sobre theme for Kopete conversations.
Available with or without the avatar bar.

It is inspired from kONE, and it enhance it.

In the future (version 2 and more), there will be the following variants:
- Compact View (pseudo and messages columns);
- Show "Hours / Hours & Seconds / No Time";
- More colors.
Oh... and the HTML/CSS code will be much much cleaner:
it's currently a patchwork ;-)

This is Kopete 0.12 style made by Sebastien Laout.
It use the powerful new xhtml+css engine.
