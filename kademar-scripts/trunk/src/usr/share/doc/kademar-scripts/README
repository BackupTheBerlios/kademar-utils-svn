	It's the name of the distro.
	Used in the start of the Live-CD

 * DISTVER:   - Default = (Content of /etc/kademar-release file)
	It's the version of the distro. The number it's used on the start of the distro
	If none is assigned, will try to use file /etc/kademar-release

 * DISTKADEMAR:  -  Default = (Content of kademar_type variable of /usr/kademar/config file)
	This is the flavour of kademar distro. Flavour it's like a sub version.
	Used, normally are Lyra, Leo, Khronos; but also can be any that you want to do. (use a new name if it's a new type of kademar)

 * ROOT:  - Default = /
	It's the place where kademar-scripts will put the files, where it create the Live-CD (Needs 500 mb at least)

	This option actually doesn't work

 * SERVICES_TO_REMOVE:  -  Default = NONE
	This will be a list, with all the services of /etc/rc?.d that you want to remove, on live-cd creation. Be aware to rebuild it with on the installed system, if you want (with update-rc.d, or ln -s).
	Example: I want on installed system ntpdate but on live-cd, no.
		-> add ntpdate to services_to_remove, and re-create the link after install on the PC.

 * UNIONFS (unionfs/aufs):  Default = unionfs
