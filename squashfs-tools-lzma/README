Squashfs Tools with Lzma patch
==============================

Squash it a compressed filesystem, to put all filesystem of a live-cd in one-single file. 
Used combined with unionfs/aufs, you are able to read-write the squashed filesystem.

With Lzma patch, squashfs it's converted to TGCP ("The Greatest Compressor Tool"). ^_^

Also, can be used as a normal compressor. With mksquash-lzma you indicate folder/s or file/s that you want and the last it's the compressed file

Compress with mksquash-lzma:
	mksquash-lzma [folders/files to compress] destination_compressed_file

Access to the compressed file, it's always as root:
	mount -o loop squashedfile destination_folder
