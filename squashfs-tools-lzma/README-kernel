To create again (due a update on squash) the mksquashfs tools:
==============================================================

1- Decompress kernel

2- Patch with squashfs

3- Patch with sqlzmaXX2-k.patch   - IMPORTANT "K", not U.patch

4- Patch with squash-cvs (OPTIONAL)


Configure kernel, and build

Happy compile!!!
